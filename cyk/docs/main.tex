\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Composed by a set of strings of symbols, a formal language can be used as a important instrument to solve problems. We can define a formal language through a grammar, which is a structure able to generate every word in the language. Grammars can be classified as regular, context-free, context-sensitive or even unrestricted, according to the Chomsky hierarchy. The classification of grammars comes from the class of problems that each language generated by each grammar are capable to solve, being regular the most simple class of problems and the unrestricted the most complex class.

One application of formal languages are the description of the programing languages 



The difference between grammars comes from the recognizing mechanism, 


Introduce the problem; explain what is the goal of a parsing algorithm; given a context-free grammar $G$ and a word $w$ as input, is it possible to check if $w$ is a member of the language generated by $G$? In our case, consider only grammars in Chomsky normal form.
