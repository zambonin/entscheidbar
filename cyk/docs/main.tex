\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Composed by a set of strings of symbols, a formal language can be used as a important instrument to solve problems (which problems?). We can define a formal language through a grammar, which is a structure able to generate every word in the language (how?). Grammars can be classified as regular, context-free, context-sensitive or even unrestricted, according to the Chomsky hierarchy~\cite{}. The classification of grammars comes from the classes of problems that each language generated by each grammar are capable to solve, with regular being the simplest class of problems and the unrestricted the most complex class.

One application of formal languages is the description of programming languages. We can use a context-free grammar to describe their syntactic rules, \emph{e.g.} a compiler gets as input a source code and uses its grammar to check if the lines of code are syntactically correct, in other words, if the source code is a "member of the language". 

The process of analyzing a word and checking its membership in a language, considering the rules of a grammar, is called parsing. There exists different types of parsers, according to the different types of languages. For the context-free languages, where the grammar are in Chomsky normal formal, we can use the Cocke–Younger–Kasami (CYK) algorithm. 






% Introduce the problem; explain what is the goal of a parsing algorithm; given a context-free grammar $G$ and a word $w$ as input, is it possible to check if $w$ is a member of the language generated by $G$? In our case, consider only grammars in Chomsky normal form.
