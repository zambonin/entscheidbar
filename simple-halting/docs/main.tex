\section{Simplified Halting Problem}\label{sec:halting}

It is known that there exists no procedure which can determine if any program halts or not, as seen above. However, there exist deciders that can know if strings belong to a certain formal language. This is exactly the set of recursive languages. For instance, every context-free language is decidable~\cite[Theorem 4.9]{Sipser:book:2012}. Many other examples of languages that always halt exist. Such is the case of what we call the Simplified Halting Problem (SHP), described by Demasi~\cite{Demasi:misc:2013:may} in an assembly-like format. We briefly cover its details and prove that it is decidable after.

The main characteristics of SPH lie in their limited syntax and arithmetic operations. Commands are divided into three groups: (i) usual conditional branches that compare two integers and a copy operation; (ii) arithmetic calculations modulo $1000$, with the additional restriction that dividing and taking the modulo of zero is equal to zero itself; (iii) looping constructs in the form of a \texttt{CALL} command, and program return \texttt{RET}, that accept one argument. Further, there are ten registers that compose the ``memory'', where \texttt{R0} and \texttt{R9} receive input and place the output from the third group of commands, respectively.

Note that there is only one method of looping, that is, recursive. This is exactly what the \texttt{CALL} command achieves. As such, to execute programs of this language, it is imperative to maintain a recursion stack and ``program counters''. Moreover, all ``memory'' is not preserved between recursion calls, except for the last register. \texttt{R1} to \texttt{R8} can be seen as scratchpad registers. We present below an example of source code for SPH and execute it step-by-step. Note that syntactic limitations such as delimitation of conditional branches and uppercase enforcement is not discussed. The first line informs that the program has $8$ lines and that its first input is $9$.

{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
8 9
IFEQ R0,0
RET 1
ENDIF
MOV R1,R0
SUB R1,1
CALL R1
MUL R9,2
RET R9
\end{verbatim}}

We will start by comparing equality of $\texttt{R0} = 9$ and $0$ and returning $1$ if so. This is the stop condition of the recursive loop. Then, we copy \texttt{R0} to \texttt{R1}, and decrement \texttt{R1}. We save the ``memory'' state and start a new execution of the program with $\texttt{R1} = 8$ as \texttt{R0}. This is repeated until the stopping condition is reached, and thus, the recursion stack has nine entries. When \texttt{RET 1} is executed, $\texttt{R9} = 1$ and the ``program counter'' moves to the \texttt{MUL} instruction, since it is directly after \texttt{CALL}. \texttt{R9} is doubled and returned, once again to the line below \texttt{CALL}, since it was the origin of the recursion. 

We can see that this is repeated as long as there are entries in the stack. Since the stopping condition returns $1$ and it is doubled repeatedly, the point of this program is to recursively calculate the $n$-th power of $2$, where $n$ is the recursion depth and, indeed, the input of the program.

\section{Implementation}\label{sec:imp}

The full source code for the SHP language parsing and execution unit can be read in Appendix~\ref{app:impl}, stripped of comments for brevity. We shortly discuss it in the sequence. Data structures were carefully chosen to prevent data access overhead. As such, unordered maps and sets are heavily featured, since their underlying STL implementation is a red-black tree. Additionally, hashing functions were created, to enable insertion of custom structures into these containers. 

We parse the input with regular expression rules created from the description of the problem~\cite{Demasi:misc:2013:may} and check for any syntax errors. We must note that, while the program description says that arithmetic is limited to modular arithmetic modulo $1000$, there exists a wrong input program that features exactly this number. Hence, the program has a workaround to accept this variable. Further, the input value limit of $100$ is also not respected --- we believe it is a typo and should be $0 \leq n < 1000$. Helper functions that translate values from the ``memory'' and parse each program line into a valid ``instruction'' are given shortly below.

Lines 113--158 present the function that loops over an entire program and evaluates its lines, following the control flow if needed. It takes into account a ``program counter'' and a recursion stack, essential to simulate the inner works of the toy language. If instructions are arithmetic or conditional, a function map is invoked to decide what should be executed. Further, in the case of arithmetic functions, recall that operations have to follow a set of rules that, for instance, allow division by zero.

The most complex behaviour of the code, however, is met when parsing instructions that enter and exit recursion states. An optimisation is added here, that features memoisation of previously calculated recursion states. This allows the code to pass the $\frac{1}{8}$ of a second time target, since there are input programs that calculate large Fibonacci numbers, and it is known that if intermediary results are not memoised, this calculation will take a very long time. Evidently, the recursion stack is modified, the ``program counter'' is reset, and values are returned as usual.

Within this code, the strategy for preventing infinite loops is also implemented. It is enough to compare the last two recursion states for equality, as discussed above. Note that the hashing function used in this comparison was not carefully constructed as to prevent collisions, but it seems to distribute all ``memory'' states distinctly. Finally, once the instruction is parsed, the ``program counter'' is incremented and the program may return if it finished its execution.

All programs are executed and results are printed according to the problem definition. After determining its correct parsing and execution of the toy language, the code was taking $30$ ms to calculate the entirety of the input. Parsing instructions takes a considerable amount of time, but this cannot be memoised, \emph{e.g.} \texttt{ADD R1,R2} may appear in two programs, but have completely different meanings depending on the contents of the ``memory'' at each ``program counter'' state.

Using simpler string structures, manual translation of strings to integers, and substituting the ``memory'' from a map to an array lead the code to execute in $8$ ms. Correctly emulating recursion loops, as well as these performance improvements, were the main obstacles. Further optimisations can be achieved if large parts of the code is rewritten, for instance, removing function maps and regular expressions. Ergo, to prevent reduction of code readability and maintenance, we leave it as is.
